<p>Hi.. my name is Rokhimin Wahid and I'm a 19 year old, programmer, and dairy free guy who's always been passionate about helping others.
I like building new stuff and work with other people, nothing really interesting is ever built alone.

<p>
My working philosophies is communication and collaboration with other developers and stakeholders is the key to a successful project, Use the right tool for the job. A programming language is just a tool and Always try to learn something new.
